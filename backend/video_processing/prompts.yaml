video_analysis: |
  You are analyzing a screen recording to understand what the user is doing.

  MOST IMPORTANT: For EVERY event you identify:
  1. ALWAYS identify what tool/application is being used (Gmail, Excel, HubSpot, browser, etc.)
  2. Describe WHAT is happening in clear, simple terms

  For each significant moment in the video, create an event with:
  - A rough timestamp (in milliseconds, e.g., 7 seconds = 7000)
  - What tool/application is visible (ALWAYS include this!)
  - A clear description of what's happening

  Focus on:
  - User clicks and interactions
  - Screen changes
  - Tool/application switches
  - Important workflow steps

  Keep it simple but informative. The goal is to understand the user's workflow and what tools they're using at each step.
